version: '3'

services:
  httpd:
    image: httpd:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs


In this configuration:

version: '3' specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
Under services, you define the services you want to run. 
In this case, there's only one service named httpd.
image: httpd:latest specifies the Docker image to use for the httpd service. This pulls the latest version of the official httpd image from Docker Hub.
ports: - "80:80" maps port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container, allowing you to access the Apache server from your host machine.
volumes: - ./html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs mounts a volume from your local file system (./html) to the /usr/local/apache2/htdocs directory inside the container. This allows you to serve HTML files directly from your local machine.
